     <p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love! Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</p>
    <p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</p>
    <p>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman &mdash; and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. I've done everything the Bible says &mdash; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</p>

      <p>I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip; Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip;</p>
      <p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! I've done everything the Bible says &mdash; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
      <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.</p>

       <p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip; Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds&hellip; Oh, I've wasted my life. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
       <p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip; Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
       <p>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</p>
