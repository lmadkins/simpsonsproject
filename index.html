     <p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love! Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</p>
     <p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</p>

      <p>I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip; Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip;</p>
      <p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! I've done everything the Bible says &mdash; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>

   <p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip; Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds&hellip; Oh, I've wasted my life. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
   <p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children&hellip; Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
